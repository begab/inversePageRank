# Supplementary code for the paper _Efficient algorithm to compute Markov transitional probabilities for a desired PageRank_

This repo includes the code for performing Reverse PageRank calculation.  
In this setting the network topology and the importance of the nodes (i.e. the stationary distribution of a random walk) are assumed to be known in advance and algorithm looks for a weighting of the edges which ensures that the random walk visits each node proportional to the importance of the nodes provided in advance.

## The quickes way of trying out the programme (assuming Maven being installed)
Assuming access to Maven, the quickest way to give the algorithm a try and also to see a visualization is to enter  
```mvn package```  
in the command line.  
Note that running the above command creates a file named `inversePR.txt` in the current working directory with details of the learning procedure printed to it.

## Reading in graphs
Relying on the functionalities provided by [Graphstream](http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Tutorials/Reading-files-using-FileSource/), it is possible to work with networks in multiple popular network formats (including the DOT, TLP and GEXF formats).  
The `hu.u_szeged.graph.reader.GraphReader` is an easily extendable class which (on default) operates on the `airplanes-sample.gexf` sample input file in the GEXF format.

## Dependencies
Our source code relies on the following dependencies (also included in the pom.xml for Maven.)
